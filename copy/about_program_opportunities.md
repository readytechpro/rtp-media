# Opportunities

This page will host the "Opportunities" portion of our platform, which will generate employment and volunteer opportunities though product development contracts once everything is in place. 

## Under Development

For now, we are still in the process of establishing our nonprofit and are working on developing each of our programs. Developing the programs of this platform will provide many volunteer and employment opportunities, as well. 

Positions will be held solely on a volunteer basis until we can achieve our exempt status and begin fundraising. 

## We Need Your Help
Please see our Volunteer Projets page to find out about specific ways to contribute:

As long as you share our desire to help those in need and you are able to communicate using technology, we could use your assistance! Even if none of these projects appeal to you, we will certainly have something for you to do.
