All of our programs are currently in development. If you want to help, please join our [Community](https://www.readytechpro.org/community)!

## What is this program?
This program will make it easier for people in our community to find free, relevant, high-quality online learning resources. Our Resources program will help people find, share, organize, and track free online learning resources from all over the Internet. 

## Program Features
- Discover learning "tracks" that organize resources from around the web to help you learn a particular technical skill.

- Use our system to follow your progress through each item on the list. Move at your own pace, keep notes, and check off items as you feel they are complete.

- Add items like notes or additional resources to your private version, or publish your updated learning track to help the community.

## Who will this program help?
This program is intended to provide and continuously improve on a system that will make it easier for disabled people learn specific technical skills. We will develop this program according to the needs of our target community, but it will help further our mission if it is something that all ability levels want to use.
