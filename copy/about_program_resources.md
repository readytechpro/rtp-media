# Resources

### Under Development
For now, we are still in the process of establishing our nonprofit and working on developing our programs. If you want to help shape Ready Tech Pro, please join our [Community](https://www.readytechpro.org/community) and share your ideas and expertise! 

## What is this program?
Our Resources library will host collections of curated links to external resources which will provide a clear learning path for a wide variety of technology skills.

Each skill or technology will have its own learning path, a "track" as we call them. 

## Program Features
- Discover learning tracks that organize resources from around the web to help you learn a particular technical skill.

- Use our system to follow your progress through each item on the list. Move at your own pace while monitoring your progress.

- Add items like notes or additional resources to your private version, or publish your updated learning track to help the community as more external resources become available.

## Who will this program help?
This program is intended to provide and continuously improve on a system that will make it easier for disabled people to learn specific technical skills. We will develop this program according to the needs of our target community, but it will help further our mission if it is something that is useful to anyone.
