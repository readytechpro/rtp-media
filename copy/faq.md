# What is Ready Tech Pro, Inc.?
Our company is a nonprofit public charity pending 501 (c)(3) approval. We are registered in Oregon. We are currently in the process of developing our programs on this platform. We hope that providing these services will help people living with a disability improve their quality of life. 

# Who can join?
We welcome anyone who wants to help others. We need all ability levels so we can reach as many people as possible. Certain services must be limited to those who identify as a member of our target community. 

# What is a disability?
We generally follow the ADA definition for disability. We will never ask you to explicitly qualify your level of disability to us. Full services will be available to members who can acknowledge that they live with something that impacts their ability to find work.

# How can I get involved?
We need help from everyone who is willing to offer us some of their time. See our Opportunities page to learn more.

# Will this organization rely on grants and donations?
Not for long! Once we have our full platform in place we will be operationally sustainable; we won't have to depend on grants and donations to continue reaching people.

# How can I donate?
We aren't quite there yet! Soon we will be able to accept tax-deductible donations from across the US. For now, just send a message to tell us about your moral support. Choose to be added to our mailing list to stay up to date on all of our official business.
