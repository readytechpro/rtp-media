Our mission is to help those living with a disability start a new career in software product development. 

Our programs will provide free technical training resources, a supportive community of other professionals, a network of collaboration partners for portfolio projects, and volunteer or employment opportunities. We strive to empower everyone in our community with the skills and confidence they need to succeed.
