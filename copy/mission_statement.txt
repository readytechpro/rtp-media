Our mission is to help those living with a disability start a new career in software product development. 

Our programs will provide access to free technical training resources, a supportive community of other professionals, a network of collaboration partners for portfolio projects, and volunteer or employment opportunities. We hope these programs can help more people gain the skills and confidence they need to succeed.
