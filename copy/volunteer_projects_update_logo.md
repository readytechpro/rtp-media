# Project: Update Logo

## What's the Project?
We need someone with graphic design experience to help update our company logo.

This is what we have for now, but it is low-resolution and needs a few improvements. 

Reproduce this layout in your design program of choice so you can change a few things and export a high-resolution graphic for us to use on our materials. 

![Current Logo](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nr_mRkNBjQi5WnPqxp3tcQzYReim9N7fexC3NqFy-5rsTq7pYJX4Wn58tXvMzE-djJjmjARohMNE4EkQvpV4XM1cSXw_h9rR-1rsJRgoT-GbFYqN6Q=w1280)

## Project Requirements
Reproduce our current logo in your popular graphics program of choice. We need a standard working file format for the finished design that future volunteer designers can work from. 

Enlarge everything within and including the square computer monitor icon so that the sides are about the same width as the large green circle. 

Overlap most of the black monitor stand icon with the bottom side of the black square. Let slightly less than half of the height of the stand icon still stick out.

Remove the large green circle.

Export working files of popular design program. 

Export a high-resolution PNG with transparency, at least 1000 x 1000 pixels.

Submit the files to Ready Tech Pro.

## Who should Apply?
Please apply if you want to help our cause and can satisfy the project requirements. 

This project could lead to more responsibility.

Get permanent credit for your contribution by allowing us to submit the files to our GitHub account. This helps us track all of the progress we make over time and will provide a public record of your service. 

## How have we prepared to make it easy to help? 
You can find our graphic assets here, but for now we just have a tiny copy of this image there. 

The information on this page should be all you need to complete this small project! 

## How will we implement your completed work?
When you are finished, you can just send the files to info@readytechpro.org (or I can talk you through how to personally submit the files to our public file repository). 

We will put the logo to use immediately! 

We will replace all current instances of our logo.

We will have more opportunities where we can use the new high-resolution graphic.
